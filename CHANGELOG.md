v2.0.0

The `it works again!` update: 

- A large refactor, so I decided to bump up the major version.
- Fix embarassing errors with copy-pasted JS code from 1.5 years ago.
- Add proper RTSP data framing, other than whatever was there.
- Remove Babel/Gulp entirely, we only use what Node v6.0+ supports as far as ES6.
- Add yarn.lock for anyone using Yarn.
- Fix example.
